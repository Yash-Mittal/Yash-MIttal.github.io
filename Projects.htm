    <p>Some of my Projects and Interns : </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: circle">
<li> <b>CORRELATION OF BOND LENTH AND BOND ENERGY  </i> (Project Guide: Prof .S. Manogaran, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> To find whether there is correlation of bond energy and bond length of a particular bond in small molecules and apply this correlation on larger systems or molecules by using Gaussian 09 software program (to find correlation).
Good correlation has been found. Now, we can calculate bond energy and bond length for similar type of bonds in very different and larger system of molecules using correlation coefficient. We can find values using smaller basiset and with the help of that can predict value for higher systems.
The proposed method saved computational time and was cost & economically convenient.  
</li>
<li>Supply Chain Challenges: Building Relationship </i> (Project Guide: Dr. R.R.K. Sharma, IIT Kanpur)
</br> Report shows that majority of the barriers to internal supply chain integration occurs on a cultural and organization level.
The supply chain power relationship are found to be direct and positive for non-mediated power resources and negative for medicated power resources.
Study showed that Risk & Trust are two factors to build a bond between buyer & seller who are complementary to each other.
 </li>

<li> Fermi Resonance </i> (Project Guide: Prof .S. Manogaran, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br>Term Paper on Fermi Resonance observed in CO2 molecule; Harmonicity and the effects of anharmonicity.
Studied the molecular rotations and vibrations (stretching and bending) in polyatomic molecules.
Fermi resonance results in the splitting of two vibrational bands that have nearly the same energy and symmetry in both IR and Raman spectroscopies.
</li>
<li>Project Guide: Prof .S. Manogaran, IIT Kanpur </li>

<li>3-D Building Modelling <i> (Project done under MAAC Animation and Animation Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Complete 3d model of Academic Affairs building of IIT Kanpur was made using 3ds-max software.
</li>

<li>Calculator <i> (Made in Takneek'11 Electronics Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made a calculator using basic IC's which performed addition, subtraction and multiplication-division(by 2).
</li>

<li>Wall following Robot <i> (Made in Techkriti under Robotics Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made an autonomous robot which has to traverse a path by following a wall in compliance with the rules provided
</li>

<li>Project model of crane machine  <i> (Project Guide: Dr. J Ramkumar, IIT Kanpur ) </i>
</br>Designed and fabricated a model of crane machine. 
Involved processes such as sheet metal forming, brazing, casting, welding and other manufacturing processes
</li>

<li>Project model of truck <i> (Project Guide: Dr. Anish Upadhyaya, IIT Kanpur ) </i>
</br>Designed and crafted a model of truck 
Used various mechanical processes like lathe machining, Drilling, Milling, Filing 
</li>

</ol>
